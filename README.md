# Photography Portfolio Template

This is the project I used to create the website patrickgillespie.com. 

## Create sized photographs

To create sized images run this helper script:

```bash
node utils/create-images.js -i /directory/to/full_sized_photos/
```

It'll create sized images as well as a metadata object for the app.

## Running

```bash
npm start
```
